Input Format :
The first line contains a comma-sepatared list of the stack elements. 
Next line contains "push", "pop", "peek", "isEmpty", or "size" depending on the required operation.

Output Format
push: prints the stack after the push operation.
pop: prints the stack after the pop operation.
peek: prints the top element of the stack.
isEmpty: prints "True" or "False".
size: prints the size of the stack.
If any error occurs, print "Error"
